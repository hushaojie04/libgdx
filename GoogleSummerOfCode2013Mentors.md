# Google Summer of Code 2013 Mentors #


Mentors are reachable through IRC (irc.freenode.org, #libgdx) and the [forums](http://www.badlogicgames.com/forum). Once a student is assigned to a mentor, the student will also receive IM and e-mail information, which we don't list here for hopefully obvious reasons.

## Xoppa ##
Xoppa's been working on libgdx since 2012. His main focus is on the [3D API](http://www.badlogicgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=7020), linear algebra classes and the [bullet physics](http://www.bulletphysics.com/) wrapper. You can find him on the forums (fredF) and occasionally on IRC (xoppa).

## Noblemaster ##
Noblemaster, alias Christoph Aschwanden, has been contributing to libgdx since the end of 2011. He's running [Noblemaster Games](http://www.noblemaster.com/), a small indie studio that creates games for the desktop, iOS and Android. Noblemaster is mainly focusing on iOS and networking support. You can find him on the forums (noblemaster) and on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/noblemaster).

## Bach ##
Bach, alias Stefan Bachmann, has been with us since early 2011. He's previously been spearheading The Greystudios and is now the the chief of [Robotality](http://thegreystudios.com/blog/), a small indie studio creating games for desktop and mobile platforms. Bach's been one of the first huge contributors to our forums, relentlessly helping new comers by answering millions of questions. He's touched so many different parts of libgdx that we can't enumerate his contributions anymore. Bach can be found on the forums (bach), IRC (bach) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/stbachmann).

## Nexsoftware ##
Nex, alias Nexsoftware, alias Justin Shapcott, joined the libgdx effort in early 2011. Just like Bach, he's been roaming the forums since forever, lending a hand to everybody. He's the good soul making sure the GWT backend keeps working, has designed and implemented the new maps API (together with siondream) and knows pretty much all parts of libgdx inside out. Nex can be found on IRC (nexsoftware, or mobidevelop if he's in a bad mood), the forums (BurningHand) and on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nExSoftware).

## Tamas ##
Tamas, alias Impaler, alias Obviam, alias Tamas Jano, was one of the first persons to help with documentation, write tutorials and care for the community. He's also been our wall for bouncing off new ideas and API designs over the years. Tamas also wrote one of the most [frequented libgdx tutorials](http://obviam.net/index.php/getting-started-in-android-game-development-with-libgdx-create-a-working-prototype-in-a-day-tutorial-part-1/). He's been working with Nate and badlogic during their stay a mobile gaming startup in San Francisco and has since become the heart and soul of libgdx. You can find him on his excellent [blog](http://obviam.net/), on the forums (impaler), on IRC (impaler) and on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/obviam).

## Nate ##
Nate, alias Nate, alias Luigi, alias door knob cleaner, has been with libgdx since mid 2010, just a few months after its inception. He's considered to be the co-creator of the framework, though legend has it that he really only made Mario do all the work while claiming credit for it. Nate's reigns over [Esoteric Software](http://esotericsoftware.com/), who just recently celebrated their successful [Kickstarter for Spine](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/esotericsoftware/spine), a 2D skeletal animation tool. Nate's been working on things like the LWJGL backend and the 2D scene graph and UI API. He's also keen on invading Mario's flat from time to time. Nate can be found on the forum (NateS), IRC (NateS) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/esotericsoft).

## Badlogic ##
Badlogic, alias toilet scrubber, alias Mario Zechner, is the creator of libgdx. He's come up with the initial silly thought to build a true cross-platform Java game development framework and hasn't since given up on that idea. Mario's spending most of his spare time on libgdx, and is responsible for most of the API atrocities in there. Nowadays, he's mostly involved with the build system, issue tracker, pull request reviews, community and team managment and building new backends, which eats up precious time he'd otherwise spent on adding features. He's also the author of ["Beginning Android Games"](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1430230428/ref=s9_psimh_gw_p14_d7_i2?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=center-2&pf_rd_r=0RNW3X4VYXPTAWTVKFTS&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=1389517282&pf_rd_i=507846), through which he lures in new victims to the libgdx community. Mario can be found on his [blog](http://www.badlogicgames.com), on the forums (mzechner), on IRC (badlogic, or badlogic1 if he forgot to logout on another computer) and on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/badlogicgames)
