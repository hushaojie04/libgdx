# Google Summer of Code Student Application Template #
**Before tackling your application, please read this [wiki article](https://code.google.com/p/libgdx/wiki/GoogleSummerOfCode2013) first. Follow the steps given, then come back here.**

To apply for Google Summer of Code, you will have to write an application letter (aka proposal). Below, you can find our template for such a letter. It will give us and the GSoC board some insight into your motivation, skills and previous experience.

The content of the application is the basis for how we rank your application with respect to other applications. We assume that the GSoC board will do the same. Here are a few things to consider when writting your application:

  * Show us what your motivation is. Why do you want to work on libgdx?
  * Your skill level needs to match the idea you propose to implement. Be realistic, try to push yourself, but don't go overboard.
  * Make sure to describe your skills and previous experience, link to code and so on. Failing to do so may result in us ranking you lower, just because we couldn't get a proper picture of your skills.
  * Previous experience with libgdx or game development in general is a plus. If you send a pull request previously, or wrote a game with it, make sure to note that in your application.
  * Be honest, there's no shame in not knowing everything.

Make sure to fill out all the questions below. **You may not be able to answer all questions. Worry not, the application is not a test. Try to be as detailed as possible. You are also allowed to go beyond the questions asked below!**.
